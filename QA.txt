Questions & Answers related to the code

I collect here questions that have puzzled me and are probably to puzzle me again. More than anything else, this is my attempt to understand my own code...

Q: Why is ROIMaps in the output of defineSphericalROIs a list and not an np.array?
A: We don't know beforehand the size of ROIs: voxels not belonging to the analysis mask can't be added to a ROI and therefore some ROIs contain less voxels than they would if they were perfectly spherical. Therefore, it's not possible to pre-define ROIMap as an array. Further, it can't be turned to an array later on: as different ROIs contain different numbers of voxels, the dimensions wouldn't match. Same applies to ROIVoxels: different ROIs have different numbers of voxels.

Q: Why is the output key of findROIlessVoxels (and findROIlessNeighbors) ROIlessMap in singular, not ROIlessMaps in plural?
A: There is only one map: the coordinates of all ROIless voxels are on the same array. xMaps type objects (with plural names) are lists of corodinate arrays, e.g. one array per ROI.

Q: Does updateROI return the original ROIInfo modified or a copy of it?
A: It returns a modified version of the original ROIInfo. This means that the original contents of ROIInfo are lost. If one expects them to be needed for further analysis, they should be saved separately.

Q: Are voxels in the same order in the voxelCoordinates array (output from readROICentroids) and in the time series file?
A: Yes, they are. In readROICentroids, the voxel coordinates are read ROI by ROI in the same order as they are in in the ROI map. On the other hand, in the time series file, voxel time series are listed ROI by ROI in the order given by ROI maps.
